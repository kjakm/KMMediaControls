KMMediaControls
===============

KMMediaControls is a simple way to add standard UI controls to an audio player.

- In your controller create an instand of KMMediaControls, pass it the URL of the file you want it to play (via AVAudioPlayer)
, and add it to your view.
- You will instantly get a view with play/pause buttons, a seek bar, and two labels showing the current playback time and the total time of the file.
- There are a few options you can set including autoplay and the behaviour when the stop button is pressed (pause or stop and resent audio file to beginning). 

Check out the included sample project to see exactly how it works.
